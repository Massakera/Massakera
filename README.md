### Hello, I'm Enzo Massaki  👋

## I'm a Self Taught Software Engineer from Brazil, interested in Open Source, Virtual Machines and Lambda Calculus.

Don't be scared with so many projects around here. I like to learn by making mistakes and correcting later, like a mad scientist 👨‍🔬.

**About me**
-  Studied Mathematics for almost three years at Federal University of Santa Maria. Having one of the best grades in the class. Dropped out because i found out that i love progamming and software engineering.
-  I love to read papers and books related to CS Theory, specially about PLT and Distributed Systems.
- 💼 Software Engineer at [Airg]([https://accurate.com.br](https://corp.airg.com/))
- ❤️ I love to spend time with my two cats and watching some weird anime.
